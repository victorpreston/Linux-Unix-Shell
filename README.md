0x16. C - Simple Shell
======================

-   By Julien Barbier
-   Project to be done in teams of 2 people.

Concepts
--------

*For this project, students are expected to look at these concepts:*

-   [Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/64)
-   [Approaching a Project](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/350)



### Output

-   Unless specified otherwise, your program **must have the exact same output** as `sh` (`/bin/sh`) as well as the exact same error output.
-   The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your `argv[0]` (See below)
